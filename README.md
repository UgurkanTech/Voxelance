A Minecraft clone.

Minecraft clone crafted entirely from scratch. It boasts an unlimited procedural world, dynamically generated through Perlin noise. The game showcases multi-threaded chunk generation and advanced mesh optimization, incorporating a proprietary procedural mesh generation algorithm optimized through bit-wise operations and advanced code optimizations. In future developments, the project aims to enhance mesh calculations using compute shaders on the GPU, ensuring efficient rendering. Additionally, multiplayer support is on the horizon, featuring special world-saving algorithms that calculate changes based on the world seed, elevating the gaming experience.
